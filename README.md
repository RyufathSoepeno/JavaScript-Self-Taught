# JavaScript-Self-Taught

This is front-end based, so all this should be alter linked to html. 

However, most can refer this as back end since it ahs characteristics of one, good luck ;-)



You can use this tho:
<!DOCTYPE html>

<html>

	<head>
    <title>Name </title>
	</head>

	
	<body>
		<script src="JS_NAME"></script> <|=============================
	</body>
</html>
